### 🎯 Clone Only a Specific Folder Using Git (For Developers)

If you want to **clone only a specific folder** from this repository instead of downloading everything, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/moonCake95/web_projects.git
cd web_projects
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set <folder>
git checkout
```

🔹 Replace `<folder>` with the actual project folder name you want to clone (e.g., `gameColor-master`).

---

## 🔧 Usage

Each project has its own **README.md** file that provides setup instructions, dependencies, and how to run it.

For example, if a project requires Node.js, install dependencies with:

```bash
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm start
```
